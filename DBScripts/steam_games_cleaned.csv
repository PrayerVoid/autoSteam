If you enjoy puzzle solving, colorful worlds, and dark undertones this is Lucid Dream is for you.§ 8/10 每 gamingcypher.com",13,Dali Games,Dali Games,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/773090/header.jpg?t=1583939879,http://www.dali.games,http://dali.games,contact@dali.games,,"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_80978d6616fb532643461ad110435101dab826fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_6a01d1f523c901212dfbb302c290981cc840a569.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_c3893137ba2fa5a33698acd10cbf2046092d0488.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_02b38f825ae06e5f39147e2d8700299e8b8891f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_9135953b8fe932ef01e439aecf8e7a87f187d69f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_8d76e0e89b09242ccc64fd6face489ac382f8562.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_738c1cf3d76cf9808379690be121574299ce7fe9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_42af026d6a4c9aff1fe9185a4f9cfc1e305a59c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_bc5e7bd59c8ce7b04ac1cde55daca4986c99e364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_edd0bd73de309a2b3a4bdae37f0e90cc8ae8c996.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_68478282be099744a947aa100b8c725372c67099.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_61f4fff890cdc5a29cff51da01eda93437712a0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_9d44a40fdd73bb2d2ae53b67748b9d7168584cef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_c28fa3dd7de488531c9a2e90691d6fb72fe2b23f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_ece77592197a871ffa006f82e743d6abb65303e2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_21dc88c7f62455e4293fb529302f95f5edaf2e3d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_454d366139abd9a8d5b4f7955c0d90220d752120.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_d1b27ca6f0dd2813669260c198772c44dd513309.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_e2bee8860578ee04b8267a8befcadc5d4c1dd945.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_585daee2e11dd8fc39ac6c9e02b02d1b8c96975d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_eb589593816bed739278f3a48191b7dfe665bd9a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1635590/ss_dff52f127ce69a91eceefd019044d017cd05cf11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1679043792","http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256855640/movie_max.mp4?t=1670254375,http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256865973/movie_max.mp4?t=1642755545,http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256849675/movie_max.mp4?t=1634888531,http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256912770/movie_max.mp4?t=1666712066"

It's a game about the aftermath of terrible events, but here the aftermath has teeth and claws of its own.§ Rock, Paper, Shotgun",23,Screwfly Studios,Screwfly Studios,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/337040/header.jpg?t=1707437853,http://www.deadnaut.com,http://www.deadnaut.com/support,support@screwflystudios.com,,"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_2532df847ff41f494c56df472e5266f9bc9fd294.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_ba2a667933a79d1589acdf8ca0cadc529a4f3c2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_bf9c83bd2ea2912380482a97fdf485d3b07fc188.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_c235533ba028fb209908bdeb441123c2da3f97b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_fff8a66fca1f312219103cc6cb412ce0e38106a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_94dd454889086d775385a2569805823ba2c7372e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_7c24302a2be4581c657f15316a301e82ad9b5278.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_980100f64a0e0b4b5603da52eae40384efec5d5e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_d0b2811d156e05dcbb8670a08a2e87560cc6dd0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_551d13bd8e068686a463416847380a4973aa903e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_190cfc7510126518920b361c955646f827de88ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_51e19c027093a7eadf85ce84cb6a41ae7af5a9b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_a7075e60685f11eb762c0450a652932bf3f7c6b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_4b3f8a6c9a4fc556e5d53bae5e58f3017889b862.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_1169ff0db6729783c13b19d981b83369675839d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/298520/ss_f2da22d6b5289b5f1ec78ad0675e47ed6b011d2a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1703197366",http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/2033806/movie_max.mp4?t=1447363047

Yes the gameplay is casual but this is a highly developed, well-rounded, offering from Arcen Games that puts many games of higher price to shame.

Rumbora Party Games lays it all on the line with their new title Tinker Racers, a top-down racer with an elimination edge. This proposition certainly keeps players on their toes, especially when threats stand in the way between you and victory. The AI is balanced just right, without coming across as brain dead or overly cheap. The environment can often be a bigger obstacle than the rival racers, but familiarity and memorization help a great deal 每 just like the best arcade racers on the market. Tinker Racers pint-sized racers put the pressure on with its elimination-based gameplay.

Pleasing visuals, good music/sound, an intriguing setting/story and fresh puzzles round out this surprising little gem.§ 8/10 每 Doctors of Gaming ※Big experiences can sometimes come in small packages and the time that you spend with The Search will be one that you will reflect on for days after you step away from it.§ GameRaven",9,Jason Godbey,Jason Godbey,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/566190/header.jpg?t=1724975284,http://www.jasongodbey.com/the-search/,http://www.jasongodbey.com/the-search/,jasongodbey07@gmail.com,,"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_317ea5a6fd07f3c5638eff005c11b38c82e2ca7e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_125593870357685432dbaadb9ea82cfe8a578b33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_3df5ef3228d05e93122ba1f7accf1edd6e305619.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_ab6bf2d3383ec19f444ce185f450e7f0e87845d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_81c6597901cfcc61827c2e41eaea5cf4949e3cd5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_68dcaa6afaad8510b01e30031444a6708230a665.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_768848022e2da7d8a074f374db6f6f68e21ac3db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_0182ada3d22a6144709f2477fdaf0aa59854451d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_8af0b950a643279600cb2e27091facd158ab716f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_35e994d02011b612f80790f8880c90d4869040bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_945085f00ef5abe2914ab23e44ca6fdfcd019e8d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_78a4fae4f5acad8af5741a950df8b01e4076188f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_e30756b7ebd36a839aba5ba246bfcdfcd64c691d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_39e07abd5ab997677265dc36f70fe149b24b5597.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_a61f80a7d5af25bd224dae3030b76fc538e9ca4f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_80199d86901b53e23cd56f9e277ece933ea6895d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_18160f495e078cc9210b4ba26844f874a80676b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_08cb60809593628ff13e078adf809f9e42f94eaa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/576260/ss_7ccb006ebfd37195b887c841b8f619249fd00090.1920x1080.jpg?t=1713425955",http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256678771/movie_max.mp4?t=1485897566
